Write a function
object Solution { def solution(a: Array[Int]): Int }
that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

Assume that:
- N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
A = (2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1)
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Complexity:
- expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage
  (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
